// This class is derived from the KaliVeda class KVReconRawDataAnalyser.
// It is to be used for analysis of events reconstructed from raw data.
//
// The following member functions are called in turn:
//
//    InitAnalysis():  called at the very beginning of the analysis
//    InitRun():       called every time a run starts
//    Analysis():      called for each event
//    EndRun():        called every time a run ends
//    EndAnalysis():   called after all requested data has been read
//
// Modify these methods as you wish in order to create your analysis class.
// Don't forget that for every class used in the analysis, you must put a
// line '#include' at the beginning of this file.
