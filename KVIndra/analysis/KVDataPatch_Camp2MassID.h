/**
\class KVDataPatch_Camp2MassID
\brief Correct mass identification in 2nd campaign data
\ingroup INDRADataPatch

Correct bad attribution of isotopic resolution & mass in 2nd campaign data:
    - all particles identified in Phoswich detectors (Ring 1) were labelled as being isotopically identified.
    - calculated masses were not consistent: several A for some Z. We give single KVNucleus::kVedaMass A to all
